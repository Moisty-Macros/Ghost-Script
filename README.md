[ENDERFLAME SCRIPTS 2.0] CRACKED

NEW FEATURES
- BLACKLIST: This is a list of igns and nicks that the script should look out for and avoid being in the same lobby as.
- ACCURACY: Within all the past versions the accuracy for aiming at the ghosts was quite off and was basically a guess on where the ghosts would be.
- MOVEMENT: This update has improved movement and added randomized left and right movement, with this new movement I have noticed around a 80-90% decrease in deaths.
- AOTV RETURN: Rebuilt the entire aotv return code, will continue to try to make it to forge and wont start trying to tp until its 100% in forge.
- WEBHOOKS: Player detection (tells you who came near you and sends you their skycrypt), Famous person(detects a famous person in your lobby and notifies you) and so much more to be added (need suggestions).
- NEW AUTO ITEMS: Auto orb, auto pigman, auto wand and auto tuba (all can be toggled in the config).
- PERFORMANCE BOOST: Stripped mod of threads, re coded lots of parts to make it less heavy on your cpu/gpu.
- MORE CONFIG: Around 6 more customization settings!
- ROUND UP FEATURE: Added a feature that used to be a bug within the code (this rounds up all the ghosts to the middle).
- NEW LOCATION: I finally added a whole new location to macro in, makes a bit less rates than normal spot but is a lower chance of being banned.
- BUG FIXES: You can now have chat open for it to continue working, no aotv detected will now double check since it was being stupid.

COMING IN FUTURE UPDATE

- PLAYER DETECTION: Added a new setting for it to go up to the side of the ghost area before swapping lobbies to look more legit.
- HUD OVERLAY: This will include (Ghost kills, xp per hour, ghosts per hour, players detected in the past hour, etc)
